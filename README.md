# How to Run the Code

## Download Required Packages
`pip install requirements.txt`

## Running the code
- Go to `CS184a_Final.ipynb` and click the `Run All` command at the top
- We did comment out a single portion of code where we do multithreading to test all permutations
- Instead, we load in a pickle file that contained the results to save time

## Original Output of All Cells with Full Dataset
- The original output using the full dataset can be found in `CS184A_final.pdf`.
- We tried to originally output as HTML, but then cells were getting cut off so we used PDF instead
